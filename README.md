# Frogger-AI

## Overview

This Python program implements a simplified version of the classic game Frogger, with an AI component that controls the movement of the frogs. The game environment consists of various obstacles such as cars, logs, and turtles moving across the screen, and the goal is for the frogs to safely navigate across the river to reach the other side.

## Features 

Population of Frogs: The program simulates a population of frogs, each controlled by an AI algorithm.
Generating Algorithm: The frogs' AI behavior is optimized using a generating algorithm, where the fittest frogs from each generation are selected to produce offspring for the next generation.
AI Movement Integration: The program integrates AI movement using Q-learning, where the frogs learn to navigate the environment based on rewards and penalties associated with their actions.
Obstacle Avoidance: The frogs must avoid colliding with moving cars and falling into the river by jumping on logs or turtles.

## Usage

Ensure you have Python installed on your system.
Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory.
Run the froggerAIfinal.py script using Python to start the game.
Use the arrow keys to control the movement of the frogs.
Watch as the AI-controlled frogs attempt to reach the other side while avoiding obstacles.

## Dependencies

Python 3.x
Pygame library

## :computer: Run program :computer:

To run the program just start the Python script by running `python froggerAIfinal.py` or the equivalent command in your system.

The rest of the codes are just trials based on another set of frogger assets that I found publically available the final code is the froggerAIfinal.py
